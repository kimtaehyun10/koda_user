									What we are pursuing is this one simple phrase "Sharing Life".<br/>
									KODA(Korea Organ Donation Agency) is an affiliated organization operated under Ministry of Health and Welfare.<br/>
									In order to provide good health and wellness to the organ faliure patients at the end stage of life, who need urgent organ transplantation, we are in charge of all processes concerning organ donation from deceased donor since the implementation of the Transplant Act in 2000.
								</p>
								<p>
									Pearl S. Buck, who won the first Nobel Prize as woman in America, once noted that Korea is such a noble and civilized nation composed of warm hearted people.<br/>
									We can make a fine consent toward her saying when we visualize and imagine “couple of persimmon left at the top of the tree for wild birds in the winter” and “warm heart of the farmer who helps his cow on the way home after the hard work.”
								</p>
								<p>
								This suggests that Koreans are warm-hearted human beings who care not only each other but also even farm animals.
								</p>
								<p>
									But, ironically when it comes to the question of organ donation, we all tend to hesitate making a firm decision regarding this complicated matter.<br/>
									Whether it is derived from the traditional ideas of Confucianism (Never harm your body given by your parents even after your death) or from the improper information concerning organ donation, this realistic fact means organ donation in Korea is not sufficient for Korean patients’ needs.
								</p>
								<p>
									The fine effort that we pursue to support and develop organ donations in my country  may refer to the means to preserve and promote national characteristics such as kindness, love and care.
								</p>
								<p>
									We are responsible for everything about brain death organ donation in Korea, searching for the potential brain death donors, brain death judgement, brain death management, obtaining consent from donor family, donor organ recovery, emotional support for donor families after recovery surgery, education, and public relations.<br>
									For more than 10 years, we have been working hard to establish firm legal system and medical experience based upon organ donors and their family's dedications.
								</p>
								<p>
									As a result, organ donation rate is on the rise thanks to the dedications of medical staffs and organ donors.<br>
									However, still some patients end their lives because of insufficient organ donation. It is reported that about five patients pass away everyday while waiting for transplantation.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our goal is to support every people to live happier and healthier lives in Korea.<br>
									As we, KODA, have done so far, we will try our best not only to honor the noble spirit of the organ donors but also to save more lives of patients.
								</p>
								<p>
									We all know that donation does not mean “the end of life”, but it is “beginning of new life."<br>
									KODA will always be there with you, in dreaming of “no patient enlisted on the waiting list for organ transplantation" in the near future.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thank you.
